            <!-- <h2>Webzine Party: Building our garden plots</h2>
            <p>Lets take some time to add our files into git hub together in a wonderful webzine party.</p>
            <p> We will add our garden plots by making our cave paintings clickable, which will then lead us to a portal page. Then we will add our homepage as our code.</p>
            <div>
                <p><em>Github is confusing!</em></p>
                <p>For the beginning of class, lets get more acquainted with github and uploading our files to github.
                </p>
                <p>Remember that you want to have the current version of code up before you push your changes as to not
                    override any code. The difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code> is that
                    <em>git pull</em> tries to automatically merge. It is <em>context sensitive</em>, so Git will merge
                    any pulled commits into the branch you are currently working on. this automatically merges the
                    commits <strong>without letting you review them first</strong>. If you don’t carefully manage your
                    branches, you may run into frequent conflicts. <code>git fetch</code> gathers any commits from the
                    target branch that do not exist in your current branch and <strong>stores them in your local
                        repository</strong>. However, <strong>it does not merge them with your current branch</strong>.
                    This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on
                    something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your current
                    branch, you must use merge afterwards.

                    <p>You may have asked yourself by now:<em> "I want my local files to overwrite the remote repo, but
                            git says that I first have to pull those remote files in and merge them. Is there any way to
                            pull but make sure that the local files are not overwritten by the remote?"</em></p>

                    <p>1.<code>git stash</code><br>in your local repo. That will save away your local updates into the
                        stash, then revert your modified files back to their pre-edit state.</p>
                    <p>2. <code>git pull</code> <br>to get any modified versions. Now, hopefully, that won't get any new
                        versions of the files you're worried about. If it doesn't, then the next step will work
                        smoothly. If it does, then you've got some work to do, and you'll be glad you did</p>
                    <p>3. <code>git stash pop</code> That will merge your modified versions that you stashed away in
                        Step 1 with the versions you just pulled in Step 2. If everything goes smoothly, then you'll be
                        all set! <br> If, on the other hand, there were real conflicts between what you pulled in Step 2
                        and your modifications (due to someone else editing in the interim), you'll find out and be told
                        to resolve them. Do it.<br>Things will work out <em>much</em> better this way - it will probably
                        keep your changes without any real work on your part, while alerting you to serious, serious
                        issues.</p>

            <h2 style="padding-top: 0%;">Homework: Alt Text Poetry Gardens</h2>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            </div>
            <p>Today we looked at more CSS to style layouts. What better way to practice than designing a layout for our
                own garden? Use the example code to design your own garden plot. Your garden can be literal or
                metaphorical, meaning it could be of plants or other entities. Collect whatever will live in the garden
                and place them in the layout of your choosing. In every <code>img</code> tag, add <code>title="your
                    message here"</code>. Whenever you hover over the image, that text will show up.

                <p>Push all your code from homeworks to github. This should be your current file structure in your
                    folder:
                    <ul>
                        <li>your name
                            <ul>
                                <li>images
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            any-image-files.jpg
                                        </li>
