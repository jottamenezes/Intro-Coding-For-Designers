            <h2>What is a website anyway?</h2>
            <p id="disclaimer">A semi-neurotic thought spiral about websites</p>
            <p>A website has ever-evolving definitions, and depending who you are asking, the answer would most likely vary. A website might be space to collect, hold memories, connect. It might be a place to trade, sell and grow. It could be a space to explore and a never ending labyrinth for discovery. Do we always need to search or can we be still on the internet?</p>
            
            <p>What is the relationship between the internet to a website? The internet is to ______, as a website is to _________.</p>
                
            <p> That leads me to then ask what <em>affordance</em> does a website provide for a human? In interactive design, according to Adobe, affordances are "a relationship between a person and a physical or digital object." Human to website affordances yield a result. What result do you hope a website you create will yield?</p>

            <p>We are returning to the early days of the internet and establishing our own home pages. This can be a page that you feel would invite a visitor like you would when you open your door to your home. But continuing the theme as website as a metaphor, what is your website? </p>
                <p> You can respond to this prompt by articulating your idea however you would like. Is it cool drawings or doodles that you want to share? A poem or short story, even? A map to your favorite place or maybe even a made up land?</p>
                <p> What ever it is, this is your first web page in our collective web zine. So you should introduce yourself the best way you know how.</p>
            <p>Include a list of interests and hobbies you can use <a href="https://des117.space/su2020-menezes/jhmenezes/Selected-Exercises/wk1b-PersonalWebsite/index.html">this page</a> as inspiration ~ We are only doing HTML structure for this so far, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v6gNnTB9U2MAwQ3tSB43JwswQcGHz1a4f0IRKxj8oMM/edit?usp=sharing">here are some slides</a> that will help you set it up. </p>
