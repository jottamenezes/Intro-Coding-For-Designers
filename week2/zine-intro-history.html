            <h1>Zine Aesthetics and the Experimental Web</h1>
            <p>Zines often use creative layouts, unusual typography, and expressive illustrations that can inspire designers to push boundaries and experiment with new techniques and styles. They prioritize individual voices and perspectives, allowing designers to express themselves authentically and connect with audiences on a personal level.

            <!-- Zines, also known as fanzines or mini-mags, are self-published and self-distributed print publications that emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They are usually created with a photocopier or other low-cost printing methods and are often produced in small quantities and distributed through mail networks, independent bookstores, and other alternative channels.-->

        <!--  The idea of hand coding comes from an interrogation of the shift from physically programming, actively adjusting switches and weaving software where computer scientists were writing code for computers the size of rooms. It was meant to be understood by the computer not by the people who were making the programs. There is a reflection of this in the way we look at code currently, which is illegible jargon and often minified to become unreadable blobs of text. -->
      
        <!-- So this brings me to the idea which will be the heart of this class. The handmade web. Olia Lialina, an internet artist and theorist writes in her Essay, Vernacular Web, that the web in the mid 90's for a lack of a better term was "bright, rich, slow, and under construction". It was created by early inhabitants of the internet, just learning how to create a space and make it their own. Olia refers to these inhabitants as "indigenous", amateur programmers just getting the lay of the land. She describes this as the amateur web and being a thing of the past, but describes the aesthetic that quickly was overridden by "dot.com ambitions, professional authoring tools and usability guidelines." This image is an example of a web page from geocities. That WTF level of weirdness was in no small part thanks to GeoCities, a web-hosting service that made it possible for people to build their own home pages. -->
    
        <!-- So this brings me to my next point. Was there a quality that the early web that was more genuine? The entrance into someone's personal home page felt like typing into the address bar was knocking on the front door and pressing enter was being let in to their foyer. And that's where we will begin our exploration of handmade web and see for our selves. But before we can style and make things look pretty, we have to learn how to structure and place text, images, notes, drawings, poems, etc. -->

        <!-- Laurel Schwulst, wrote an essay called "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?" and it brought light to the potential of seeing a website as a metaphor. She speaks to a common response from people she has taught to make a website, that despite having the technical skills to code, the actual act of "creating a website" that would then be seen in the world, today. She says "There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity."  -->

We will take turns as a group to add a line of text. It can be weird and funky and nonsensical. All we are looking for are strings of writing so we can edit it in html. In the chat, we will add a line of text one by one popcorn style. I will edit a txt file with what we add. Then you can copy the text for yourself. ^_^ -->
